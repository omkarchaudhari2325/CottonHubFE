    "description": "The cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) is mostly found in the younger parts of plants; often on the underside of leaves and shoots. The cotton aphid can be winged or wingless. The wingless aphid has a stocky, round body shape of 0.9-2.8 mm in size. This size depends on temperature, food availability and population density. Its color varies from pale yellow to black-green. It also has red eyes and black siphuncles on its lower body (this is the most important distinguishing feature for identifying this aphid).The winged cotton aphid is on average slightly larger, has a black head and body and a yellow/dark green abdomen. The winged cotton aphid siphuncles are also black and short. For prompt detection of aphids, signaling rolls can be used. It is difficult to determine on sticky traps what aphid is involved but they do indicate the cotton aphid infestation. In doubt about the type of aphid? Then read our article on aphid control.",
    "damage-symptons": "The cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) is an important vector for viral diseases. This aphid species can transmit more than 50 different viruses, including the cucumber mosaic virus.Nymphs and adults extract nutrients from the plant and disturb the balance of growth hormones. As a result, the plant’s growth is retarded giving rise to deformed leaves or, if the infestation occurs early enough in the season, the death of young plants. Retarded growth and defoliation reduce yield.Plant sap is rich in sugars, but has a low protein content. Aphids therefore need to extract large quantities of sap to get sufficient protein. The excess sugar is secreted in the form of honeydew, making the crop and its fruit sticky. Black fungal moulds (Cladosporium spp.) grow on this honeydew, contaminating fruit and ornamental crops and rendering them unsuitable for market. At the same time, photosynthesis in the leaves is reduced, affecting production.",
    "mechanical-control": "A good effective method for eliminating aphids is to simply rinse them off the leaves of affected plants. A water hose and nozzle with adequate pressure is enough to knock the aphids from the foliage, but not to damage the plant. CAUTION: A powered pressure washer is much too strong. The jet or shower setting on a dial nozzle is enough to dislodge these pests. Once off the plant, aphids cannot climb back up the plant and will often starve to death. Aphids can also be rubbed off the plants with fingers or a wet cloth. This method effective against small aphid populations and at the very early stages of infestation. Physical removal by rubbing would be ineffective at removing large infestations.",
    "biological-control": "<p>Aphids have several natural enemies that can be attracted or released to help keep populations in check. The most common one that gardeners are familiar with are lady beetles. Lady beetles and their larvae feed on many different types of aphids, and their presence in the garden should be encouraged by reducing the overall use of broad-spectrum insecticides.</p><ul><li>Lady beetles are available for purchase, but it is not recommended to buy them. They are typically harvested during their hibernation period in the western U.S., and as a result are often confused when they arrive in a gardener’s home. As a result, the lady beetles fly away in search of a new hibernation spot. For home gardeners, it is best use plants in the garden and landscape that will attract lady beetles, such as sunflowers, clovers, liatris, and coreopsis.</li><li>Another effective natural enemy that can be purchased and released is green lacewing larvae (Chrysoperia rufilabris). These larvae are extremely aggressive and will eat numerous aphids a day. Lacewing eggs are laid on a tomato and will help control aphid populations once they hatch. They can be released on specific plants that are infested for direct application or released as adults to establish in the garden. These insects can be attracted by adding plant species such as coreopsis, cosmos, and clover in the garden and landscape. Another way to encourage and protect them is to reduce the use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Lacewings are extremely sensitive to insecticides and even drift from an application can be harmful. Many lacewing adults are often killed in bug zappers used for mosquito control. These helpful predators can be purchased from online sources. It is recommended that only lacewing larvae are purchased and released into the garden and landscape.</li><li>Another natural enemy are parasitic wasps (Aphidius species) that sting aphids and impregnate them with an egg. The egg then grows inside the aphid, killing and mummifying it, and a new adult wasp hatches out of the mummified aphid.</li></ul>",
    "chemical-control": "When all other control measures have failed to keep the populations under control, a chemical insecticide may be needed. The goal with insecticide use is to choose the one with minimal impact to pollinators and natural enemies, but one that is still effective on the insect causing the problem. It should be noted that although the aphids are killed by insecticides, their dead carcasses can still be on the leaves after the application. Do not panic and make an additional application. Check to see if the aphids are still alive by nudging them with a pencil. Additional applications are only needed if live aphids are still present. The dead aphids can be removed by washing the leaves off with water. Before purchasing and using an insecticide, be sure to read and follow ALL label directions. The label is the law; therefore, the product label is the final authority on what crop or areas the product can be applied and at what rate. When shopping for an insecticide, be sure to look on the package for the active ingredient and choose the product with the proper active ingredient to control the pest. Always spray late in the day for best results and to protect beneficial insects.The first effective choice to spray would be either insecticidal soap or horticultural oil. These insecticidal products coat the aphid’s exoskeleton (body)and cause it to suffocate. These insecticides also can kill beneficial insects upon contact, but they have no residual activity. So only beneficial insects and pollinators that were directly hit by the application will be affected. Pollinators and natural enemies that arrive after the spray solution has dried, will not be impacted by these soaps or oils. Note that these products may be phytotoxic (damaging to the plant) to drought stressed plants, especially at temperatures 90°F or higher. Applications should be made when temperatures are cooler, such as the mid- to late evening to avoid any potential plant damage.",

    "description": "Powdery mildew is a fungal disease caused by Erysiphe cichoracearum and other related species. It affects the aerial parts of the cotton plant, primarily the leaves, stems, and bolls. The disease is characterized by white to grayish powdery fungal growth on the surface of the plant tissue. Powdery mildew thrives in dry, warm conditions and can spread rapidly if not managed properly.",
    "damage-symptoms": "Symptoms of powdery mildew in cotton include:\n- Leaves: White or grayish powdery spots appear on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves. As the infection progresses, the spots enlarge and coalesce, covering entire leaves. Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and eventually drop prematurely.\n- Stems: The fungus can also infect young stems, leading to stunted growth and reduced vigor.\n- Bolls: In severe cases, powdery mildew can affect bolls, leading to poor boll opening and reduced fiber quality.",
    "mechanical-control": "Mechanical control methods for managing powdery mildew include:\n- Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and fallen leaves to reduce the source of inoculum. Clean equipment and tools regularly to prevent the spread of the pathogen.\n- Pruning: Prune infected leaves and stems to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the crop canopy, which can help prevent the spread of powdery mildew.\n- Weed Control: Manage weeds that can harbor the fungus and act as a source of infection for cotton plants.",
    "biological-control": "<p>Biological control methods involve the use of natural antagonists and enhancing overall plant health:</p><ul><li>Resistant Varieties: Planting cotton varieties that are resistant to powdery mildew can significantly reduce disease incidence and severity.</li><li>Beneficial Microorganisms: Introduce beneficial microorganisms, such as Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum, which can suppress the powdery mildew pathogen on plant surfaces.</li><li>Soil Health: Improve soil health through the application of organic matter and compost, promoting a diverse and resilient soil microbiome that can help reduce pathogen levels.</li></ul>",
    "chemical-control": "Chemical control methods include the use of fungicides to manage powdery mildew:\n- Fungicides: Apply fungicides such as sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, and myclobutanil to protect cotton plants from powdery mildew. Follow label instructions for application rates and timing to ensure effective control.\n- Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Incorporate chemical controls with other management practices to minimize the risk of resistance and protect beneficial organisms.",
